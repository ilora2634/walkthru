What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? <br>
I had basically no previous knowledge of any sort of coding. The only knowledge I had was from a high school class called AP Computer Science Principles I took about 2 years ago which went over basic coding to solve problems with algorithms and programs. I learned about computer systems and other parts of coding like boolean expressions or if statements. This class has greatly expanded my knowledge of the topics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and has taught me how to apply this knowledge to many different aspects of web development. <br>

Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch? <br>
I used the portfolio provided by the class instructor because when we started this project for the midterm I didn’t feel like I could build my portfolio from scratch. Now I think that I could probably build my portfolio from scratch as I have expanded my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>
<br>
What was your most challenging part of your portfolio? <br>
The most challenging part of my portfolio was probably the CSS for the validation page. Firstly it took a long time to get all of the code screenshots and find a way to add them to my code. But making them into columns with the html validation on the right and the css validation on the left was particularly challenging for me with the CSS and formatting that properly. <br>

How did taking this class change your view on Web Development? <br>
This class changed a lot of how I thought about web development. I originally thought that it might be kind of boring as I have taken previous coding classes that I did not enjoy. I took this class because it works well with the major in cognitive science and is a useful skill for expanding my knowledge and business. I have thoroughly enjoyed this class and the projects that we have done and learned a lot so I have a much different view on Web Development now. I see it much more positively and am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>

What would you recommend to future students taking this class? <br>
I would recommend that they don’t procrastinate as some projects may take a long time and others might be very easy and you won’t know until you are actually doing the assignment. The amount of classwork each week is very easily doable as long as you don’t wait until the last minute to do all of the assignments. I also recommend that they ask questions. I didn’t ask very many questions in slack but I wish I did more often as it would’ve helped me better understand what I needed to do and how to code specific things. <br>
